# login_php
A web application designed to authenticate users to restricted content.

To use this application it is necessary to install the XAMPP program. With the program open, the Apache and MySQL module should be started. In your computer's "C:" directory, locate the "xampp" directory. Inside there is a folder called "htdocs", this folder is the public directory of the module "Apache". Transfer the "login_php" folder into the "htdocs" directory.

The "login_php_private" folder should be transferred into the "xampp" directory, at the same level as the "htdocs" folder.

In this way, we increase security, because the files that reveal the business secret are not located in the public directory.

On the page "index.php" contains the email and password box.

Enter the e-mail "adm@teste.com.br" and the password "1234" for testing purposes.
